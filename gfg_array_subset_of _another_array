Given two arrays: a1[0..n-1] of size n and a2[0..m-1] of size m. Task is to check whether a2[] is a subset of a1[] or not. Both the arrays can be sorted or unsorted. There can be duplicate elements.

def isSubset( a1, a2, n, m):
    
    mp={}
    for i in a1:
        if i in mp:
            mp[i]+=1
        else:
            mp[i]=1
            
    
    for i in a2:
        
        if i not in mp or mp[i]==0:
            return "No"
            
        mp[i]-=1
        
    return "Yes"
