The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of an MxN matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move to right or down.

class Solution:
    def numberOfPaths (self, m, n):
        Mod = 10**9 + 7
        result = 1

        # Calculate m+n-2 choose m-1
        for i in range(m-1):
            result = (result * (m + n - 2 - i)) % Mod
            result = (result * pow(i + 1, Mod - 2, Mod)) % Mod

        return result
